## Introduction to Google Cloud BigQuery - Course README

### **Overview:**

The Introduction to Google Cloud BigQuery course is designed to jumpstart exploration of BigQuery, the Google Cloud data warehouse. The course directs the learner to 

### **Duration:** 
10-15 min 

### **Learning Objectives:** 

By the end of this course, learners should be able to:
* Access the Google Cloud BigQuery sandbox and the Google CloudShell
* Execute SQL statements in the Cloud BigQuery sandbox or via the bq command-line tool
* Create parameterized SQL statements 
* Describe the role that BigQuery might play in the observability domain

### **Prerequisites:** 

* A Google account, to enable free access to BigQuery and the Google Cloudshell editor  
* Familiarity with SQL (Structured Query Language), to write statements to access BigQuery data 
* Experience with a Unix shell (e.g. bash) command line interface and command set, to write and run shell scripts  

### **Course Activities:** 

Through guided labs, learners will first connect to the BigQuery Console and execute SQL commands on preloaded sample table data.  They'll then enable Google Cloud Shell and the bq command-line tool in order to devise shell scripts to execute SQL queries, to familiarize them with programmtaic approaches to BigQuery data access and management. The final section describes the importance of dynamic SQL and provides a lab for learners to practice parameterizing SQL queries.

In an optional lab, learners will upload and query sample event data to BigQuery and execute SQL commands  to simulate how BigQuery might be used to manage and analyze observability event data stored in the cloud.   

### **Intended Audience:**  
Developers and Data Analysts who wish to get started with BigQuery and be introduced to how data warehouses intersect with the observability concepts. 

### **Considerations:** 

Depending on the status of the learner's Google account and their experience with BigQuery, learners may have differeing experiences as they sign up for and connect to BigQuery and Google Cloudshell.  In order to activate Google Cloudshell, you may need to provide a billing method on your Google account, although you will not be charged for using the service if you remain within the free use limits.
