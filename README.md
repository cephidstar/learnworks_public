## Introduction to Google Cloud BigQuery - README

**Overview:**

The Introduction to Google Cloud BigQuery course is designed to jumpstart exploration into the BigQuery sandbox, Google's  implimentation of a data warehouse, based on serverless architecture.  It [does this by]  and consider some practical uses for this  

 

**Duration:** 
10-15 min 


**Learning Objectives:** 

Motivate the learner as to the power of the service 
Describe some compelling features 
(optional lab motivation) 

 

Prerequisites: 

A Google account, to enable free access to BigQuery and the Google Cloudshell editor  

Familiarity with SQL (Structured Query Language), to write statements to access BigQuery data 

Experience with a Unix shell (e.g. bash) command line interface and command set,  

to write and run shell scripts  

 

Course Activities: 

Through guided labs, learners will first connect to the BigQuery Console and execute SQL commands on preloaded sample table data.  They will then connect to BigQuery through the BigQuery command-line tool and use shell scripts to execute SQL queries, to familiarize them with programmtaic approaches to BigQuery data access and management. The final lab presents a practical [   ] to convert your SQL queries to parameterized queries, You will boost the power of your queries to dynamically modify query targets.  

  

In an optional lab, learners will upload and query sample event data to BigQuery and execute SQL commands  to simulate how BigQuery might be used to manage and analyze observability event data stored in the cloud.   

 

Intended Audience:  
Developers who wish to get started with BigQuery and be introduced to how data warehouses intersect with the observability concepts. 

 

Considerations: 

Depending on the status of the learner's Google account and their experience with BigQuery,  learners may experience slight differences in the responses as they sign up for and connect to BigQuery and the Google Cloudshell editor
